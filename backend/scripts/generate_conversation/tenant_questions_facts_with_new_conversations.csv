"You: I just moved into a new apartment and it is so hot in the summer
Bot: Has your landlord told you that you can’t install a portable air-conditioning (or other cooling) unit, or placed any restrictions on it?
You: no, but shouldn't the apartment have ac?
Bot: Oregon only obligates landlords to supply built-in cooling if the building permits for your unit were issued on or after April 1, 2024 (ORS 90.320 (1)(m)). Otherwise, you’re entitled to bring in a portable A/C (or similar device) and, with narrow safety-related exceptions, the landlord can’t stop you (ORS 90.355). 

Do you know roughly when the building was constructed or last permitted?
You: its brand new, so they started accepting tenants in feb of 2025
Bot: Do you know when the city issued the building’s certificate of occupancy (or final building permits)?
You: no, how would I know that? why does that matter?
Bot: It matters because ORS 90.320 (1)(m) now says: if the building permits for a dwelling were issued on or after April 1, 2024, the landlord must supply “adequate cooling facilities … maintained in good working order.” If the permits are older, built-in A/C is optional and your right is mainly to use a portable unit under ORS 90.355.

Two quick ways to learn the permit date:
1. Ask the manager or owner (they have the paperwork). 
2. Look it up online or call the city/county building department and request the “certificate of occupancy” date for your address (it’s public record).

If the permits are post-4/1/24 and the landlord hasn’t provided working cooling, you can give written notice demanding they fix the problem; if they don’t, you can use the habitability remedies in ORS 90.360 and 90.365.

Would you be willing to email the manager today and simply ask what date the final certificate of occupancy was issued?
You: how can I find out without contacting my landlord?
Bot: You can usually pull the permit history yourself (it’s public): most Oregon cities/counties have an online “building permits” or e-permitting search—type in the street address and the system shows the issue dates for permits and the certificate of occupancy. If there’s no web portal, you can phone or email the city/county building department and ask for the “final building permit / C of O date” for the address. 

Which city (or county) is your apartment in?
You: Oregon City in clackamas county
Bot: Use Oregon City’s public permit site (Search: “Oregon City eTRAKiT permits”) ? enter your address ? look for the “Certificate of Occupancy” or final building-permit issue date. 
Or phone the Oregon City Building Division (503-722-3789) and ask for the final permit date for your address.

Would you like the direct web link?
You: yes please
Bot: Here’s the portal: https://etrakit.orcity.org/etrakit/ (Use “Permit Search,” enter your street address and look for the “Certificate of Occupancy” or “Final” permit date.)",I just moved into a new apartment and it is so hot in the summer,"[""Tenant recently moved into a new apartment."", ""Tenant finds the apartment very hot during summer."", ""Tenant’s landlord has not restricted the installation of a portable air-conditioning unit."", ""The apartment building is brand new and began accepting tenants in February 2025."", ""Tenant does not know the date the city issued the building’s certificate of occupancy or final permits."", ""Tenant wants to learn the permit date without contacting the landlord."", ""Tenant’s apartment is located in Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon.""]","BOT: Oregon habitability law gives you a few tools: 

• If the building’s permits were issued on or after April 1 2024, your landlord must provide “adequate cooling facilities” in at least one room and keep them working.  
• Even in older buildings, any air-conditioning or ventilation equipment the landlord already supplied has to be kept “in good repair”.  
• You are allowed to install and use your own portable air-conditioner or evaporative cooler unless it breaks specific safety rules, and any landlord limits on that must be in writing.  

First step is usually to send the landlord a short dated letter (keep a copy) describing the heat problem and what you want fixed or allowed. If nothing happens, remedies such as rent reduction or repairing at the landlord’s cost may be available under ORS 90.360 or 90.365.

Question: Did your lease include an air-conditioner or other cooling device that has stopped working?
USER: No, my lease didn’t include any air-conditioner or cooling device.
BOT: Because no cooling was included, the landlord’s duty depends on the building’s age:

• If the building’s permits were issued on/after Apr 1 2024, the landlord must supply and maintain “adequate cooling facilities” in at least one room — it’s a basic habitability duty under ORS 90.320(1)(m).  
• In any building, the landlord cannot forbid a tenant-supplied portable A/C or evaporative cooler unless the written lease lists a specific safety/code reason under ORS 90.355(2)–(3).

Next question: Do you know whether your building’s construction permits were issued before or after April 1 2024?
USER: I don’t know the exact date the permits were issued, but the building is brand new and just started renting to tenants in February 2025. Can I find out the permit date without contacting the landlord?
BOT: Yes. Most Oregon cities and counties publish building-permit data online; you can search by street address to see the issue date. If you tell me which city or county the building is in, I can point you to the right website. ORS 90.320(1)(m).
USER: The apartment is in Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon. Where should I look to find the permit date?
BOT: Use Oregon City’s public permit site first:

1. Go to https://permits.oregoncity.gov/etrakit3/  
2. Click “Permit Search,” enter the street address, and open the newest building-permit record—the “Issued” date is the one that matters.

If nothing shows up there (some very recent permits are still routed through the county), try Clackamas County’s “Development Direct” portal at https://developmentdirect.clackamas.us/ and run the same address search; the issue date is listed in the permit details.

Knowing whether that date is on or after April 1 2024 will tell us if the landlord must supply cooling under ORS 90.320(1)(m).  

Please check one of those portals and let me know the permit’s “Issued” date.
USER: OK, I’ll go check one of those sites! Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
BOT: You’re welcome! Once you find the permit’s “Issued” date, please tell me what it is so we can see if the cooling-equipment rule in ORS 90.320(1)(m) applies.
USER: Got it! I’ll check the permit date and let you know if it’s before or after April 1, 2024. Thanks again!
